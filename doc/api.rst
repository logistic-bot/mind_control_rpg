API documentation
=================

This is the documentation for the Aplication Programming Interface. It is
generated automatically from the docstrings in the source code. It is intended
as a reference, not a tutorial.

Note that the documentation is structured a bit differently from the source:
The API documentation documents `src.core`, and the Game documentation documents
`src.animations` and `src.scenes`.
